Existing Control Board Issues:
A) R4/R5 not connected to 3.3V (dangling in schematic and layout)
B) FTDI I/O Set at 5V, should be 3.3V
C) Not enough bulk capacitance


Communications Debug (in process, maybe solved):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I did a brief test on my "out-of-tolerence" theory, and did indeed get unreliable communications.
(Well mostly reliable with occasional dropped characters)
On the Control Board the FT232RL and the STM32 are running using internal oscillators,
both using internal clocking and running without external crystals.
So, when you add the baud rate error of each, that sum is "out-of-tolerence" and losing data.
In order to get the STM32 clock accurate enough for either the UART or USB,
we'll need to add a crystal to the STM32.  You could program the FTDI FT232RL
to output it's 12mHz clock, and use that to clock the STM32,
which would fix the UART dropped characters.
(you essentially make "async" comms become "sync" comms that way...)
However it is a little funky in that you need to change/reprogram the factory
defaults of the FT232RL, and it would not enable you to use the STM32 USB,
as the STM32 requires a more accurate clock than that.

Control PCBA (completed) :
-----------------------------------
Constraints : Leave all connector types, positions, mounting holes and dimensions unchanged.

1) Separate STM32 power from VR Suit Power using existing LMS1585AIS 3.3V Voltage Regulator
2) Add second 3.3V Voltage Regulator (LDO) for STM32 ( MIC5365-3.3YC5-TR3 = $0.12
3) Add PCB stuffing option for  STM32 USB support using Wireless Connector.
4) Change FTDI USB-UART from UART1 to UART2 (RX/TX/RTS/CTS)
   Change FTDI VCCIO from 5V to 3.3 volt (CPU)
5) Change Wireless Connector from UART2 to UART1
6) Add 8mhz Crystal, series resistor, and tuning capacitors to STM32
7) Add Ferrite bead for USB Power input for EMI/FCC tests.
8) Add Ferrite beads to separate sensor power (Jx,jy) from motor noise on bulk 3.3V line
9) Remove BMD-300 footprint (add to Wireless Board)
A) Regenerate Gerber files with improved CAM & DRC files
     for 7 mil trace/space rule using tented vias to reduce solder shorts in manufacturing

I only have the Gerbers for the Bosch IMU Board and the Motor Driver Board,
(if they are done in Eagle, you could send me those as well...)
so those are little more difficult to review (just having layout),
but this is what I've seen so far :

Bosch IMU Board (initial review):
--------------------------------------------
1) Minimal Bulk Capacitance, add larger (47uF/1206)
2) No local Pull-up on SDA/SCL, might be subject to noise/droop/etc.
3) No Ferrite Bead on DC input
4) No reset control, (RC circuit) etc.
A) Regenerate Gerber files with improved CAM & DRC files
     for 7 mil trace/space rule using tented vias to reduce solder shorts in manufacturing

Motor Driver Board (initial review):
--------------------------------------------
1) Minimal Bulk Capacitance, add larger (47uF/1206)
2) No local Pull-up on SDA/SCL, might be subject to noise/droop/etc.
3) No Ferrite Bead on DC input
4) No reset control, (RC circuit) etc.
A) Regenerate Gerber files with improved CAM & DRC files
     for 7 mil trace/space rule using tented vias to reduce solder shorts in manufacturing
Q) DRV2605 datasheet sez 75mA @ 3.3V per motor, so 8 x 75ma = 0.6 A so < 1A per ARM/LEG?


Wireless/Battery Board (in process):
--------------------------------------------------------------------
(working on specifications)

Chest Board (completed):
----------------------------------
1) Changed RGB LED to three (3) 0603 discrete LEDs
2) Added 47uF (1206 Package) bulk capacitor (optional stuffing)
3) Added 10K Ohm Pullup resistors on SDA/SCL lines (optional stuffing)
4) Added NSVR Logo to Rear Side of PCBA
5) Added Revision Date to Top Side of PCBA
6) Changed top flood from Power (3.6V) to GND (Ground) for better EMI/FCC
7) Fixed copper flood for 10 mil isolation/spacing
8) Generated 2d & 3D models for documentation
9) Generated PDF documetation for schematic and layout
A) Regenerate Gerber files with improved CAM & DRC files
     for 7 mil trace/space rule using tented vias to reduce solder shorts in manufacturing
